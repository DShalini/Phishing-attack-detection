**DETECTING PHISHING ATTACKS USING ML**

**About**

Over the past decade, various methods to counteract phishing attacks have been suggested to detect and mitigate these threats. Despite these efforts, existing techniques remain ineffective and lack accuracy. Phishing is a type of cyber-attack that falls under social engineering, where malicious actors manipulate users to disclose their credentials by using a deceptive login form. This form then transmits the acquired information to a server with malicious intent. This paper aims to contrast machine learning methodologies, offering an approach adept at identifying phishing websites through the analysis of URLs.

**Features**

Detects fake URLs and legitimate URLs. Extract features from URLs such as domain age, length, presence of special characters, use of HTTPS. Analyze the content of web pages or emails for suspicious keywords, misspellings, grammar errors, etc.

**Requirements**

1. Requirements gathering
2. Dataset collection
3. Evaluation development
4. Software development

**System Architecture**
